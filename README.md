# An Interactive Google Map

Part of learning is always looking for new tutorials. So, I'm trying a few out of a book titled [*jQuery HOTSHOT*](http://www.amazon.com/jQuery-Hotshot-Dan-Wellman-ebook/dp/B00BFQ61GU) (by Dan Wellman). After all, I could use a bit of a refresher on jQuery, and some of the tutorials in the book seem fun to try out! This prototype is based on the Chapter 3 tutorial. Not only will it help with some JS and jQuery practice, but I haven't worked too much with the Google Maps API -- why not kill a few birds with one stone?
